Goal is to create a checkerboard of various numbers of rows and columns.

Each square is a div defined by the css for its class...except for color which is defined inline dynamically based on pararmeters pass in URL.

Logic of color determination:
---if row# and col# have the same even/odd property, then color1....else color2
-------That could be accomplished with multiple if or a switch/case, but it turns out that if the sum of two numbers is even, then they both have the same even/odd property, thus
---------if (row# + col#) is even  then both are same property and thus should be color1

Loop through rows by the height and cols by the width

Enhancements:
--Handles the cases when user does not enter anything or improper parameters in URL by giving default 2 cols and 2 rows

Future enhancements:
--Allow user to select colors
